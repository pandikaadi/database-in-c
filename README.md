B+ Tree Key-Value Store
A lightweight key-value store built from scratch in C, featuring a B+ tree for indexing. Designed for high-performance storage and retrieval, with support for dynamic page management and efficient key lookups.

Features
âœ… B+ Tree-based indexing for efficient searches

How It Works
This database stores key-value pairs using a B+ tree structure, with each node stored on disk. When inserting data:

1. Find the correct leaf page
2. Insert the key-value pair, shifting values if necessary
3. Split the node if it exceeds the maximum capacity
4. Promote a key to the parent node to maintain balance
